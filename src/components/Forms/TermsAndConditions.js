                Volunteer Cleanups are intended to clean public streets and
                sidewalks, excluding parks and beaches. Tools may not be used to
                clean private property, such as vacant lots, yards, abandoned or
                occupied houses.

                Trash is to be bagged and placed at an intersection or address
                on your cleanup route. The local offices will be notified of
                your event and bag placement. If the pickup location changes,
                you must notify us by email immediately.

                DSNY requires two weeks' notice to schedule a Volunteer Cleanup.

                We also need to know about cancellations or changes to date,
